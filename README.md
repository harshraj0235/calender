## External Dependencies

Below are the key dependencies used in this project:

### Frontend Dependencies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For routing between views.
- **Material-UI**: A library for pre-built React components.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Moment.js**: A library for managing date and time.
- **React Calendar**: A component for displaying calendar events.

### Backend Dependencies

## How to Build the Application

### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

1. Install **Node.js** from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install **MongoDB** (locally or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url/calendar-tracking-app.git
   cd calendar-tracking-app
   
### Step 2: Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install backend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the MongoDB connection in backend/config.js:
javascript
Copy code
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/communication-tracking', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true
});
Create API endpoints to handle:
Authentication (login/register)
Communication tracking (CRUD operations)
Reporting (PDF and CSV generation)
Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based access control for different user types (Admin, User).

### Step 3: Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up React Router for different views such as:
Home Page
Communication Log
Calendar View
Reports
Create UI components using Material-UI:
Login and Registration forms
Calendar component to display scheduled communications
Tables to display logs and analytics
Use Axios to make requests to the backend and handle authentication, data fetching, and communication tracking.

### Step 4: Connecting Backend and Frontend

In the frontend/src directory, create an api.js file to centralize API requests:
javascript
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';

const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5000/api';

export const fetchCommunications = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(`${API_URL}/communications`);
  return response.data;
};
Update React components to fetch and display data from the backend.

### Step 5: Testing and Debugging

Write unit tests for both the frontend and backend using testing libraries like Jest and Mocha.
Use Postman to test the backend API routes.
Manually test the UI components for usability and responsiveness.

### Step 6: Deployment

- Backend Deployment (Heroku)
Create a new Heroku app:
bash
Copy code
heroku create
Deploy the backend:
bash
Copy code
git push heroku master
Set up environment variables for MongoDB URL and JWT secrets on Heroku.
Frontend Deployment (Netlify/Vercel)
Push the frontend to GitHub.
Link the repository to Netlify or Vercel for easy deployment.
Set the frontend to fetch data from the live backend URL.
## Usage
Once the application is deployed, users can:

Register/login to the system.
Add and manage company communication details.
View communication activities on the integrated calendar.
Set up reminders for upcoming communications.
Generate and download PDF/CSV reports.
